In legal terms, the policy or practice has a \"disparate impact\" and is not \"job related and consistent with business necessity.\"\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTags: employment, labor, Job site, boss, employee\u003c/p\u003e","archived":false,"created_at":"2015-08-20T21:21:32.153Z","featured":false,"resource_id":"127271","state":null,"title":"Can an employer use arrest and criminal records to reject a job applicant?\n\n","updated_at":"2015-08-20T21:21:32.153Z","id":"55d644dc56f2f4001e00001d"},{"answer":"\u003cp\u003eLegally, no, an employer may not withhold a final check.

For instance, an employer might be liable for invasion of privacy if a female employee discovered that the employer had installed surveillance cameras in a locker room or restroom, and was regularly viewing the footage from the cameras.

Paternity actions to recover the cost to government for payment of aid to families with dependent children (AFDC or welfare) are commonly brought by local government agencies (such as the office of the district attorney) throughout the country to hold a parent responsible for child support, even when s/he has never been married to the other parent.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTags: family law, children, child, marriage, mother, father\u003c/p\u003e","archived":false,"created_at":"2015-08-20T21:21:33.184Z","featured":false,"resource_id":"3476","state":null,"title":"Can one parent be ordered to pay child support even if she never married the other (custodial) parent?\n\n","updated_at":"2015-08-20T21:21:33.184Z","id":"55d644dd56f2f4001e0000d2"},{"answer":"\u003cp\u003eYes, the parents may enter into a written agreement with regard to which parent will have primary custody and control of the minor children and providing for visitation arrangements for the non­custodial parent.

Usually, both parents are granted joint legal custody; meaning that both parents have an equal say in making the day to day decisions related to their children’s health, safety and general welfare. Physical custody simply refers to the allocation of time spent with each parent. Over the years, many states have done away with the term “sole custody” and simply order that the parents have joint physical custody then determine the percentage of time that the child will spend with each parent. This is usually done through the use of some type of parenting plan that is either agreed upon by the parents and submitted to the court. If the parties cannot agree on this, the court will listen to arguments from both parents and then make a decision. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn making any decision regarding how much time a child will spend with either parent, or which parent will have primary custody, the court will always make that determination based upon the “best interests” of the child standard. In using the “best interests” standard, a court will look carefully at both parents in order to determine if there are any factors that make it better for the child to spend more time with one parent than the other. For example, if the mother has an 80 hour per week job and the father works part-time, that would be an important factor. In addition, any issues that either parent has related to a substance abuse problem, present or past criminal activity or any other type of unstable lifestyle will be carefully evaluated.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTags: family law, children, child, marriage, mother, father\u003c/p\u003e","archived":false,"created_at":"2015-08-20T21:21:33.245Z","featured":false,"resource_id":"127484","state":null,"title":"In custody proceedings, how does the court decide who gets the children?\n\n","updated_at":"2015-08-20T21:21:33.245Z","id":"55d644dd56f2f4001e0000e1"},{"answer":"\u003cp\u003eIn general, after a divorce case is filed, if the parties cannot agree upon a support amount, then the court will order some type of “interim” support.

The use of a revocable living trust requires more ongoing monitoring to ensure that assets remain in the trust and that newly purchased assets are titled in the trust. For instance, a grantor who transfers funds to a second financial institution (perhaps to obtain a better interest rate) must remember to advise the new institution to title the new account in the trust.

If your landlord sues you for rent or damages after you leave, it will be up to a judge to determine whether you had a good enough reason to break your lease. To protect yourself if you do break the lease, you should give the landlord as much notice as possible that you are moving. Your landlord has a duty to try to re-rent the apartment. After you move, watch the paper for ads, and keep an eye on the property you vacated.

Every state has an unlawful detainer procedure whereby a landlord gets a court order to evict a tenant quickly and at low cost. The proceeding commonly requires first serving the tenant with a “notice to quit,\" which notifies the tenant that the landlord is kicking the tenant out. State law varies regarding how many days notice a tenant is entitled to before the tenant can actually be evicted, but it is usually between 3 and 7 days. The landlord must then wait for the number of days to expire and then file an unlawful detainer action with the court. If the landlord \"wins\" the unlawful detainer action, then the landlord gets a court order or judgment for possession of the property. It is illegal for the landlord to physically remove the tenant, lock the tenant out or remove the tenant's belongings. In most states, it is the sheriff who will enforce the judgment/court order and escort the tenant out of the unit. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTags: real-estate, real estate, realestate\u003c/p\u003e","archived":false,"created_at":"2015-08-20T21:21:34.534Z","featured":false,"resource_id":"127316","state":null,"title":"How do I evict my tenant who has failed to pay rent?\n\n","updated_at":"2015-08-20T21:21:34.534Z","id":"55d644de56f2f4001e0001a6"},{"answer":"\u003cp\u003eAsk for your deposit back and give the landlord your new address in writing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTags: real-estate, real estate, realestate\u003c/p\u003e","archived":false,"created_at":"2015-08-20T21:21:34.580Z","featured":false,"resource_id":"40188","state":null,"title":"How do I get my deposit back when I move?\n\n","updated_at":"2015-08-20T21:21:34.580Z","id":"55d644de56f2f4001e0001a7"},{"answer":"\u003cp\u003eThe notice should be in writing.

If you are on a month-to-month lease, in most states you are required to give the landlord 30 days notice to end your lease (usually that notice will be given on the day that you pay your next month's rent). If you have a lease for more than a month-to-month duration (for example a 6-month or 1-year lease), your lease may contain a provision for early termination. Sometimes leases will provide for early termination of a lease in certain situations, for instance if the landlord agrees in writing to an early termination or if the landlord agrees to a sublease or assignment of the property. If you do not get prior permission or your lease does not provide for early termination, then if you leave early you will be “breaching” the lease contract. When a tenant breaches a lease by leaving early without permission or failing to pay rent due for remaining months of the lease, then the tenant may owe the landlord money for the remainder of the lease term or until the landlord can get another tenant.

Written notice provides tangible evidence that the landlord was aware of the need for the repair. If it is not possible to give written notice, verbal notice is acceptable unless the lease requires written notice. Be sure the lease provision for notice is followed.

You may deduct these repair costs from your future rent by sending copies of the repair receipts along with the remaining amount of rent due to your landlord.

First, read the lease carefully. Your ability to get out of the lease depends on the language of your lease and the willingness of the landlord to allow you to terminate the lease early. There may be a provision which allows for termination prior to the lease term\u003ccode\u003es expiration. If so, you will need to follow the terms of that lease provision. For example, you may be required to give thirty (30) days notice and to forfeit your security deposit. Some leases impose additional penalties for early termination and require longer notice periods. You are responsible for paying rent during the notice period. Your lease is not terminated until the notice period expires. If there is not an early termination provision in your lease, a tenant can be held responsible for all the rent remaining under the lease. The landlord is required to mitigate any damages by re-renting the premises. If the landlord does re-rent the property, any rent collected must be deducted from the original tenant\u003c/code\u003es liability. For example, if a tenant terminates a twelve month lease after six months, the tenant can be held responsible for the six months rent remaining under the lease. If the landlord rents the unit to someone else after four months, the tenant is only responsible for the four months rent while the unit was vacant. However, if your lease had an early termination penalty provision, you would have to pay the designated penalty even if the unit was immediately re-rented or if it was vacant for six months. Some landlords may release you from the lease if you find an acceptable person to assume the lease. Some landlords will allow you to rent to another, called subletting. The landlord may refuse to allow you to do this. If your landlord agrees to allow you to terminate early, be sure to get in writing any agreement as to penalties or future rent owed.

Such a claim is best brought with the advice and guidance of an attorney. Generally, a landlord will not be required to compensate a tenant for the temporary loss of a portion of the premises. This should not prevent the tenant from approaching the landlord about the loss and inconvenience experience. The tenant should try to negotiate compensation for the loss. While the law may not require the landlord to compensate you, the apartment complex is a business and you are its customer. A well-run apartment complex would want to maintain good tenant relations and ensure that you will want to remain there when your current lease expires. It is usually more successful for a tenant to negotiate for a future rent credit then to ask the landlord to pay cash out of pocket. Use common sense and reasonableness when approaching the landlord. For example, was the room involved the kitchen or the only bathroom, both of which are essential for health or safety reasons? Or, was it a spare bedroom or storage area that is not significantly used each day? The landlord is responsible for making repairs within a reasonable time after being notified of the need for the repair. If the landlord undertook and completed roof repairs within a reasonable time after notice, the landlord has fulfilled his repair responsibilities and compensation to the tenant for the loss of the room is unlikely. However, if the landlord unreasonably delayed in undertaking the repairs and the tenant suffered a loss due to the delay, the tenant may have a claim against the landlord for damages to personal property caused by the delay in repair.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTags: real-estate, real estate, realestate\u003c/p\u003e","archived":false,"created_at":"2015-08-20T21:21:35.290Z","featured":false,"resource_id":"40109","state":null,"title":"The roof on my unit is leaking badly.
